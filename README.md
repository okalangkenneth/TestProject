# TestProject
I will be creating a fictitious company that manufactures farm equipment and has a system to monitor the performance of its products at customer sites. 
The system writes log files and places them in a directory. The log files are written in a format that can not be parsed by any other third party tools. 
I will be building a system that can analyze log files and any special events in them. When it finds these events it will alert the concrned parties.
